      <li>olive oil</li>
      <li>1 pound ground beef chuck</li>
      <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
      <li>garlic powder</li>
      <li>1 small white or red onion, diced</li>
      <li>2 garlic cloves minced</li>
      <li>1 small green bell pepper diced</li>
      <li>1 large carrots finely diced</li>
      <li>1/2 cup finely chopped celery (slice from top of celery including the leaves)</li>
      <li>1/2 green apple finely diced</li>
      <li>1/3 cup blanched almonds finely chopped (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>In a large skillet, preheat 1/4 cup of olive oil to medium heat for a few minutes. Add the diced potatoes. Season lightly with salt and pepper, cover and reduce heat slightly. Cook the potatoes, turning as needed until most sides are golden brown. Transfer onto plate lined with paper towels; set aside.</li>
      <li>In that same skillet at medium heat, add the ground beef. Season to taste with salt, pepper and garlic powder. Cook, stirring as needed until beef browns up nicely. If you need to, you could drain off some of the excess grease. Move the beef to the outer edges of skillet and add the onions, garlic, bell pepper, carrot and celery. Again, season the vegetables lightly with salt and pepper and saute for 5 minutes. Combine the beef with the vegetables.</li>
      <li>In the blender, combine the tomatoes, serrano pepper and water or broth. Blend on high until smooth. Pour tomato sauce into skillet with beef picadillo. Add the green apple, almonds, cumin and oregano. Stir well to combine and continue cooking at a light boil for 10 to 13 minutes, until the tomato sauce becomes thick. Taste for salt. Fold in the reserved potatoes and cook just until warm. Fold in the fresh cilantro or parsley before serving. Serve as is with rice, beans and warm tortillas or you can prepare one of the dishes suggested.</li>
